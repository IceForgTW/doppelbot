# doppelbot
Because I like designing 3d printers.

I made a deltabot, and it's really cool.  I can print really tall things.

But 3d prints are weakest in Z - printing really tall is maximizing the weak axis.

So instead of maximizing Z, I though about maximizing Y.  First concept here is the DoppelBot, which is a cube-shaped reparap that's easy to enclose, and has twice the print area of a standard reprap.  It accomplishes this 'twice as big' by the simple expedient of using two reprap heated beds.
