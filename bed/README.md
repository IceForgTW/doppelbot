# doppelbot - Bed

## Frame
The bed is made of 2020 V-rail, although the V isn't used so feel free to use regular old 2020 extrusion.  In fact, that might be the default... it needs to be precisely cut, so you could simply order the exact lengths of 2020 from Misumi.

The beams will be joined by MDF endcaps, with MDF braces along the length.  The braces hold the beams square and true, as well as support the bed surface.  


The bed surface is borosilicate glass, a 1' by 2' piece.  Underneath that are two silicone heaters, and underneath those lie a sheet of welding blanket.  Securing the glass surface in place is done with binder clips - I know, it's not elegant, but they're cheap and effective.

It might be a good idea to add a thin piece of aluminum as a heat spreader... I'll certainly be looking into that.  Wondering if aluminum flashing would do it.



## Mechanical
The bed mechanics consist of three leadscrews secured on the end panels; two on the left (where the electronics et al live) and one on the left.  Eventually I would like to use one stepper driver per screw, to support true bed leveling; right now, though, they're just going to be linked to a single Z driver.
